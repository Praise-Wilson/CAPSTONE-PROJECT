# CAPSTONE-PROJECT
In this project, I dived into a large dvd rental dataset to extract valuable information.
# Project Title
Rental Demography Analysis Using PostgreSQL
# Objective
The aim of this project was to analyse customers behaviors and preferences in renting, as well as rental rate and patterns of products which ultimately led to better and informed business decisions.
# Data Source
DVD RENTAL DATASET
# Findings
A particular movie was rented by a lot of people, some people rented variety of movies and others rented just once.
# Recommendation
Movies that have the actors in the most rented movie should be stocked up and pitched to customers as they are more likely to rent them again and that way, the sales rate will be increased.
